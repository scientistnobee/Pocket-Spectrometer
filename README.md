# Building the Pocket Spectrometer

## The Vision
I've always wanted to create a spectrometer that's barely larger than a cuvette itself. Working with bulky commercial spectrometers in labs, I was always wondering about applications of a smallest spectrometer that can fit in your pocket. That's when I discovered the perfect combination – the M5StickC microcontroller and the AS7341 spectral sensor. My goal was simple: create an ultra-compact spectrometer that anyone could use.

## Why This Matters
While commercial spectrometers offer high precision, they're often expensive, bulky, and require a computer connection. I wanted something different – a standalone device that could fit in your pocket, complete with its own display and interface, without requiring external equipment such as connection to a mobile app or a computer. The kind of tool that could democratize spectroscopy for educators, students, and citizen scientists.

## The Building Blocks

### M5StickC: The Perfect Host
I chose the M5StickC because it solved several challenges at once:
* It has a built-in LCD and buttons – perfect for a standalone interface
* Its tiny size (48.2 x 25.5 x 13.7mm) matches my miniaturization goals
* The bottom I2C port is ideally positioned for sensor integration
* It supports MicroPython, making development quick and accessible
* At just $20, it keeps the project affordable

### AS7341: Advanced Spectral Sensing
The AS7341 sensor was a game-changer for this project:
* 10 spectral channels give enough resolution for many applications
* Coverage from 350-1000nm hits the sweet spot for colorimetric analysis
* Built-in LED control simplifies the optical setup
* Low power consumption suits portable operation
* Small cost (~$17.50), makes it an extremely affordable solution

## Applications
I designed this with several use-cases in mind:
* Water quality monitoring in the field
* Quick chemical analysis in educational labs
* Color verification 
* STEM education projects
* Basic bio-optical measurements

## Technical Implementation
I've written the code in MicroPython for simplicity and accessibility. Most AI programs are good with Python code, so it is relatively easy to modify for various applications.  

## Future Work
* AS7343 has even more channels than AS7341 and is compatible with pin numbers of AS7341
* Battery optimization of M5StickC for extended field use
* Actual testing with some chemicals in water, which is the first thing to do now
* Plotting standard curves similar to IORodeo type colorimeter
